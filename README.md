# Core Components using React

This project is intended to provide a comprehensive glossary of React components to be used in projects.
It uses the theme presets and structure defined in [the @gdcorte/react-core-theme](https://github.com/Gdcorte/react-core-theme)

Some of the components are built from scratch whereas others are based in other libraries.
In both cases all the components should provide an easy to customize interface. PR's to improve them are always more than welcome.

## How to test this library locally

For local development of this library, run `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies required.

Then you can run storybook with `pnpm storybook` and see all of the components more in depth and how to interface/customize them.
