# Core Components using React

This project is intended to provide a comprehensive glossary of React components to be used in projects.

Some of the components are built from scratch whereas others are based in other libraries. 
In both cases all the components provide an easy to customize interface and you can also apply custom color presets to them. 

## How to test this library locally

For local development of this library, run `yarn install -D` to install all the development dependncies.
Then you can run storybook with `yarn dev` and see all of the components more in depth.
